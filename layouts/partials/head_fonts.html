  -
  - 1. Preemptively warm up the fonts’ origin.
  -
  - 2. Initiate a high-priority, asynchronous fetch for the CSS file. Works in
  -    most modern browsers.
  -
  - 3. Initiate a low-priority, asynchronous fetch that gets applied to the page
  -    only after it’s arrived. Works in all browsers with JavaScript enabled.
  -
  - 4. In the unlikely event that a visitor has intentionally disabled
  -    JavaScript, fall back to the original method. The good news is that,
  -    although this is a render-blocking request, it can still make use of the
  -    preconnect which makes it marginally faster than the default.
